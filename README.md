# Nice to meet you, I'm Lance! ðŸ’¡

I am a full-stack software engineer on a mission to fuel my curiousity to learn and apply the latest technologies. With a background in mechanical engineering, I thrive in problem-solving situations and enjoy the challenge of breaking down problems into digestible tasks.

With experience in instructing both programming workshops and engineering courses in my free time, I've developed an aptitude for leading team environments. I've found that teaching has not only been a fulfilling hobby, but an excellent contributor to my growth as a compassionate and perceptive leader.

Finally, as a dedicated programming student, my goal will always be to continue to refine my craft. Currently, I am exploring React Native to build mobile apps, and actively seeking full-stack software engineering positions!
